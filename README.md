# Pixel vendor modules

These are automatically-generated vendor modules to build AOSP ROMs for the following devices:

- Pixel 4 (flame)
- Pixel 4 XL (coral)
- Pixel 5 (redfin)
- Pixel 6 (oriole)
- Pixel 6 Pro (raven)

All modules were generated by [adevtool](https://github.com/kdrag0n/adevtool). [More info](https://github.com/kdrag0n/adevtool/blob/main/README.md)

## File size limit

Please note that building directly with this repository **will not work** for some devices. The following files have been removed due to GitHub's 100 MiB file size limit:

- bramble/firmware/radio.img
- oriole/proprietary/vendor/apex/com.google.pixel.camera.hal.apex
- raven/proprietary/vendor/apex/com.google.pixel.camera.hal.apex
- redfin/firmware/radio.img

Replace the files above with copies from stock factory images in order to get a working build of AOSP.
